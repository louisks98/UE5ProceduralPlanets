# Procedural planet Generator in Unreal Engine 5

This project is based on a YouTube series by Sebastian Lague on [procedural Planets](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFt_AvWsXl0cONs3T0By4puYy6GM22ko8)

The terrain for each planet is generated with a multiple noise layers
- A continent layer
- A mountain layer
- A Detail layer

All with randomized parameters.

The colors are generated by a biome system that generates 1-4 biomes per planet. Each biome has three colors gradients that are randomly choosen from predefiened color palettes.
- An ocean gradient
- A base gradient (rock/ dirt)
- A Vegetation gradient
